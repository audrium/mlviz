# mlviz

App holds machine learning experiments written in javascript:

- Gradient Descent example show how this algorithm can be used to solve a linear regression problem. It works by iteratively estimating and tuning k and b parameters of regression line (when y = kx + b) and trying to minimize the cost function (MSE).

- MNIST mini project trains a simple neural network to recognize handwritten digits from the famous dataset.

- Object Detection example uses already pretrained TensorFlow.js COCO-SSD model to detect objects in a webcam. The model is capable of detecting 90 classes of objects.
